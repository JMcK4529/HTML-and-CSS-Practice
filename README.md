# HTML and CSS Practice

## Project Description
After seeing a [social media post](https://at.tumblr.com/homoqueerjewhobbit/and-be-readable-on-mobile-probably-more-important/vx72yiwb5wag) concerning the lack of well-built and maintained websites for restaurants, I decided to refresh my skills with HTML and CSS by constructing an exemplar/template website including the most popular suggestions of commenters on the post. Some of the most popular suggestions were a plain text menu, a list of allergens and well displayed information on prices, opening hours and restaurant location.

The below image shows a histogram of suggestions appearing in the first 125 responses to the social media post.

## How to Use HTML and CSS Practice
To see the website in its current iteration, prepend "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?" to the full web address of "Home.html". (e.g. "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JMcK4529/HTML-and-CSS-Practice/blob/main/Source%20Files/Home.html")

## Upcoming...
My intention is to keep improving this template by implementing suggestions from the above histogram.
The most popular request among responders to the original post was for easily accessible allergen information. My next aim is to incorporate this information and present it in a way that doesn't require much searching. I could achieve this by adding pop-up text boxes which appear when the user hovers over item names. Including a separate page with a simple list of dishes and their ingredients in alphabetical order would make the information even more accessible and easier to parse in full.
